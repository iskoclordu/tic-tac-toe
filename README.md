Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Prepared as a project assignment for TOP JS Curriculum.

Classical Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game includes both humanVhuman and humanVcomputer modes.
Untill now there is only one difficulty level for computer mode, which is (at least ought to be) impossible to win against mode.
Two more modes will be released soon.

Enjoy it. And please if you send me your feedbacks and comments, that would be great for me as someone who is veery fresh starter of coding.
